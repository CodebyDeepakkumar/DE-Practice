Okay, this is an excellent goal! Building a project that mirrors a real-world scenario is the best way to solidify your skills and understand the practical application of GCP data engineering tools.

Let's set up a project scenario based on a popular and rich public dataset.

**The Dataset:** **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data**

* **Why this dataset?**
    * **Publicly Available:** Easy to access and download.
    * **Large Scale:** Provides enough data (billions of records over the years) to necessitate efficient processing and storage strategies, mimicking real-world data volumes. You can choose to work with a subset (e.g., one year, one type of taxi) to manage scope.
    * **Structured but Imperfect:** Primarily available in CSV or Parquet formats. It has a defined schema but often contains data quality issues (outliers, nulls, inconsistencies) that require cleaning – very realistic!
    * **Rich Information:** Contains details like pickup/dropoff times and locations (lat/lon or zone IDs), trip distance, fare amounts, payment types, passenger counts, etc.
    * **Clear Business Relevance:** Supports numerous potential business analyses (demand forecasting, pricing strategy, operational efficiency, route optimization, etc.).

* **Where to find it:** You can find links to the data on the NYC TLC website: [https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) (Data is usually available monthly per taxi type - Yellow, Green, For-Hire Vehicles (FHV)).

**The "Office" Scenario Simulation**

Imagine you've just joined a new team focused on urban mobility analytics. Your manager comes to you with the following:

---

**The Initial "Ask" (How a requirement might be presented):**

* **From:** Your Manager
* **Subject:** New Project: NYC Taxi Data Analysis Platform

> Hi [Your Name],
>
> Welcome to the team! We want to leverage the publicly available NYC TLC trip data to better understand taxi usage patterns in the city. There's a lot of potential here for insights that could help with urban planning, optimizing transportation services, or even advising local businesses.
>
> **Our high-level goal is to create a reliable and scalable data platform on GCP that allows our analysts to easily query and visualize this taxi data.**
>
> We know the data is available online somewhere (I think the TLC website?). Your first task is to figure out how to get this data into our GCP environment, specifically into BigQuery, so we can start exploring it. Let's focus on the **Yellow Taxi** data for the **last full calendar year** (e.g., 2024, or adjust based on availability) to begin with.
>
> Can you set up a process to ingest this data? Let me know your plan and when we might have the raw data available in BigQuery.
>
> Thanks,
> [Manager's Name]

**Simulating the Process: Breaking Down the "Ask" and Finding Requirements**

This initial request is intentionally broad, just like in a real job. You need to translate this into concrete technical steps and identify missing information.

**Your Thought Process & Actions (Phase 1: Ingestion)**

1.  **Identify the Core Task:** Get Yellow Taxi data for a specific year from the web into BigQuery.
2.  **Find the Data:** Locate the exact download links for the required year's Yellow Taxi data (likely monthly files in CSV or Parquet format).
3.  **Choose Ingestion Tools:**
    * **Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is the natural place to land raw data first. Create a bucket (e.g., `nyc-taxi-data-raw-[yourinitials]`). Structure it logically (e.g., `gs://<bucket>/raw/yellow_taxi/year=2024/month=01/`).
    * **Orchestration/Automation:** How will you download and upload?
        * *Manual (for initial setup):* Download locally, then use `gsutil` CLI or Cloud Console to upload to GCS.
        * *Scripted (Better):* Write a Python script using `requests` (to download) and `google-cloud-storage` library (to upload). This is more repeatable.
        * *Serverless (Advanced):* Could potentially use Cloud Functions triggered by Cloud Scheduler to periodically check for and ingest new data, but start simple.
    * **Loading to BigQuery:**
        * *Option A (External Table):* Create a BigQuery external table pointing directly to the raw files in GCS. *Pros:* Fast setup, no data duplication initially. *Cons:* Slower queries, potential schema issues if files differ, data processing happens on query.
        * *Option B (Native Table Load):* Load the data from GCS into a native BigQuery table. *Pros:* Better query performance, schema enforcement. *Cons:* Takes time to load, consumes BigQuery storage. **This is usually preferred for cleaned/processed data, but can be done for raw data too.**
4.  **Identify Ambiguities/Questions for Manager (or make assumptions):**
    * "Do you prefer the raw data loaded directly into BigQuery native tables, or should I set up external tables first for exploration?" (Let's assume for now you'll load into a `raw_data` dataset in BigQuery).
    * "The data comes in monthly files. Is that granularity okay for the raw storage?" (Assume yes).
    * "What format should we target? Parquet is generally more efficient than CSV for BigQuery." (If available, prefer Parquet; otherwise, plan to handle CSV).
    * "Should this ingestion be automated later, or is a one-time load sufficient for now?" (Assume manual/scripted for now, but plan for future automation).
5.  **Execute Phase 1:**
    * Set up GCS bucket.
    * Write/run Python script to download data for the chosen year and upload it to the structured GCS path.
    * Create a `raw_taxi_data` dataset in BigQuery.
    * Load the data from GCS into a BigQuery table (e.g., `raw_yellow_taxi_trips_2024`). Handle schema detection (or define it manually if needed).

**Follow-up "Ask" (After you report Phase 1 is done):**

* **From:** Your Manager
* **Subject:** Re: New Project: NYC Taxi Data Analysis Platform

> Great job getting the raw data into BigQuery!
>
> Okay, I've had a quick look, and our analysts have too. They've noticed some weird things – trips with zero passengers, negative durations, fares that seem way too high or low, and some missing location IDs.
>
> **Before we let the wider team loose on this, we need a cleaned, standardized version of the data.** Can you create a new table in BigQuery that addresses these quality issues?
>
> We also need to make sure the timestamps are consistent and maybe extract things like the hour of the day or day of the week, as analysts often group by these. Also, please ensure location IDs are treated consistently. Let's put this cleaned data into a new BigQuery dataset, maybe call it `cleaned_taxi_data`.
>
> What's your approach for cleaning this?

---

**Simulating the Process: Phase 2: Cleaning and Standardization**

1.  **Identify the Core Task:** Clean the raw taxi data and create a new, reliable table.
2.  **Explore Data Quality Issues (using SQL in BigQuery):**
    * `SELECT * FROM raw_taxi_data.raw_yellow_taxi_trips_2024 WHERE passenger_count <= 0;`
    * `SELECT * FROM raw_taxi_data.raw_yellow_taxi_trips_2024 WHERE tpep_dropoff_datetime <= tpep_pickup_datetime;`
    * `SELECT MIN(fare_amount), MAX(fare_amount), AVG(fare_amount) FROM raw_taxi_data.raw_yellow_taxi_trips_2024;` (Look for outliers).
    * Check for nulls in key columns (timestamps, location IDs, fare).
    * Check data types. Are timestamps actual TIMESTAMP types?
3.  **Define Cleaning Rules (Your decisions/assumptions):**
    * *Zero Passengers:* Filter out these records or set to 1 if appropriate? (Decision: Filter out).
    * *Negative/Zero Duration:* Filter out trips where dropoff <= pickup.
    * *Fare Outliers:* Define reasonable bounds (e.g., fare > $2.50 and fare < $500). Filter out others.
    * *Null Location IDs:* Decide how to handle (filter out, keep, impute - unlikely here). (Decision: Keep for now, but flag).
    * *Timestamps:* Ensure they are parsed correctly into TIMESTAMP data type.
    * *New Columns:* Extract `pickup_hour`, `pickup_day_of_week` using BigQuery SQL functions (`EXTRACT`).
4.  **Choose Cleaning Tools:**
    * **BigQuery SQL:** Excellent for this kind of transformation. You can write a `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statement or a `MERGE` statement to build the cleaned table.
    * *(Optional Advanced)*: For very complex cleaning or large volumes where SQL becomes unwieldy, you might use Dataflow (Python/Java SDK) or Dataproc (Spark) to read from the raw table/GCS, transform, and write to the cleaned table. For this project scale, BigQuery SQL is likely sufficient and recommended.
5.  **Execute Phase 2:**
    * Create a new BigQuery dataset `cleaned_taxi_data`.
    * Write a SQL query that selects from the raw table, applies all the cleaning logic (filters, data type casts, extractions), and populates a new table (e.g., `cleaned_taxi_data.cleaned_yellow_taxi_trips_2024`).
    * Use partitioning and clustering on the new table for performance (e.g., partition by `DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)`, cluster by `PULocationID`, `DOLocationID`).

---

**Further Potential "Asks" (Simulating Evolution):**

* **Transformation/Enrichment:** "Can you join the trip data with the taxi zone lookup table [You'd need to find this table - it maps LocationIDs to Boroughs/Zones] so we can analyze trips by borough?" (Requires ingesting the zone lookup table and joining in SQL).
* **Aggregation:** "We need a summary table showing the number of trips and average fare per hour, per pickup borough." (Requires SQL GROUP BY queries to create aggregate tables).
* **Automation:** "This is great, but we need new data automatically ingested and cleaned every month. Can you automate the pipeline?" (Requires using Cloud Functions/Scheduler to trigger ingestion, and maybe Cloud Composer or Workflows to orchestrate the GCS -> Raw BQ -> Cleaned BQ steps).
* **Visualization:** "Can you build a simple dashboard in Looker Studio showing hourly trip trends and popular pickup zones based on the cleaned data?" (Requires connecting Looker Studio to BigQuery).

**Key GCP Tools You'll Practice:**

1.  **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):** Staging raw data, potentially storing scripts.
2.  **BigQuery:**
    * Storing raw, cleaned, and aggregated data.
    * Running SQL for exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
    * Using features like external tables, native tables, partitioning, clustering.
3.  **Python:** Scripting downloads, uploads to GCS (using client libraries).
4.  **(Optional but Recommended for Automation):**
    * **Cloud Functions:** Serverless functions for event-driven tasks (e.g., triggered by GCS upload) or scheduled tasks.
    * **Cloud Scheduler:** Cron-like service to trigger functions or other jobs.
    * **Cloud Composer (Managed Airflow) or Cloud Workflows:** For orchestrating multi-step pipelines (Ingest -> Clean -> Transform). Composer is more powerful but complex; Workflows is simpler for linear GCP service orchestration.
5.  **(Optional for Visualization):**
    * **Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio):** Free BI tool for creating dashboards directly from BigQuery.

**How this mimics the office:**

* **Vague Initial Requirements:** Forces you to ask questions or make documented assumptions.
* **Iterative Development:** Project evolves with follow-up requests.
* **Focus on Business Value:** Tasks are driven by analytical needs (cleaning for analysts, aggregation for reporting).
* **Data Quality:** Dealing with imperfect real-world data is central.
* **Scalability/Efficiency:** Choosing appropriate tools and techniques (GCS structure, BigQuery partitioning).
* **Automation:** Moving from manual steps to automated pipelines.

This project provides a solid foundation using the tools you know (Python, SQL, GCS, BigQuery) while naturally leading you towards learning automation and orchestration tools crucial for a GCP Data Engineer. Good luck!
